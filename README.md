Rent Receipt Generator

Built something small but genuinely useful!

We own villas for rent, and managing monthly rent receipts used to be messy. So I built this simple web app to make the process quick and paperless.

🚀 Features

Auto-generated printable receipts

Smart form logic — “Select Month” appears only when Payment Type = Rent

Auto-generated receipt numbers (based on localStorage data)

Fully responsive design for seamless mobile use

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project solves a real-world issue we face regularly — that’s what I love about coding: turning small everyday problems into practical digital solutions.
